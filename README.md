# CS333_xv6_report_templates

Are you taking CS333 @ Portland State University? 

Do you hate how long it takes you to write a report? 

In this repo, I have created templates for each Project Report based off the appropriate grading rubric. 

All you need to do is fill in your correct overview/description for each section to complete your report. 

To start, 

1. click on any of the Project links below:

Project 5 : https://www.sharelatex.com/read/xjxxkztssnvk

2. Register for a new account on sharelatex.com or login if you already have an account
3. Make a copy of my template and save it into your own account
4. Start filling in the report
5. When you are finished, you can click on the 'Download PDF' icon that is next to the big blue 'Compile' button.

If you liked these templates, please give my repo a golden star!
