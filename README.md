# CS333_xv6_report_templates

Are you taking CS333 @ Portland State University? 

Do you hate how long it takes you to write a report? 

In this repo, I have created templates for each Project Report based off the appropriate grading rubric. 

All you need to do is fill in your correct overview/description for each section to complete your report. 

If you liked these templates, please give my repo a golden star!
